                I am a <em>mostly</em> self-taught software engineer and technical architect seeking full-time opportunities in product/internal tool(s) development, data-engineering, or systems design.  In the interim, I founded <a href="https://primd.app">Primd</a>, a cooperative startup that aims to develop novel tools to connect workers, employers, and educators and increase shared opportunities via a skills-first approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to Primd, I lead solution design and implementation for a small product incubation team embedded in <a href="https://www.jff.org/work/jff-labs/">JFF (Jobs for the Future) Labs</a>.  In addition to my primary responsibilities which included rapid proto-typing and technical architecture, I engaged in efforts to improve data integration and accessibility across JFF's entire organization.  With over 15 years of professional programming experience, much of that spent working in an <a href="https://www.imarc.com">agency environment</a> as a web engineer, I've worked on everything from custom content management systems to the nationwide career planning platform that supported the US Department of Labor's Job Corps program for over half a decade.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a strong proponent of open source software and have been using GNU/Linux in one capacity or another since the age of 12.  My favorite programming language is <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a>, although much of my career has been working with <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, JavaScript, and other web-technologies.  All <a href="https://github.com/mattsah/mjs">code for this site</a> is a highly experimental Nim implementation of patterns I originally developed for <a href="https://hiraeth.dev">Hiraeth</a>.  If you're curious about that sort of thing, you can <a href="/development/">take a closer look</a>.
